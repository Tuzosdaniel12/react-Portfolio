He was the central pillar and driving force to our projects successes. He is a savant when it comes to learning and understanding complex Computer Science concepts. Out of the many features that we implemented he was responsible for more than half. He is genuinely a Full Stack Developer as he is proficient in both Front End and Back End development. Any company that hires Daniel will be getting the best programmer possible!",

Without his relentless approach and untiring work-ethic neither of our two projects would have evolved into the exemplary class-projects that we were able to share with pride when it came time for presentations. Because he has such a thorough understanding of how all of the code fits together, he is able to move effortlessly back and forth between the front-end and the back-end, catching errors, coaching people up, and lending a helping hand wherever needed. Daniel's memory is impeccable and his ability to quickly absorb the intricacies of cutting edge technologies, even with limited available documentation, is honestly inspiring. I have zero doubt that he will prove to be a huge asset to whoever hires him. Daniel the real deal.",

I often competitively grinded away my nights as a student of the University of Washington's Coding Bootcamp just so I could feel l was catching up with Daniel's talents and deep understanding of the code in front him, but I'm not sure I ever did. He is an inspiration and an amazing team lead. I got the pleasure of working with him on the capstone project for the boot camp and he was a wonderful asset to the team. He always made sure that he was able to help us and other students in the camp even with his full schedule. He's adept knowledge and ability to grasp concepts quick make him a standout developer any team would be happy to have.",
